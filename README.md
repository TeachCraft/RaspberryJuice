### Commands that can't be supported

 - Camera angles

### Extra commands

 - getBlocks(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2) has been implemented
 - getDirection, getRotation, getPitch functions - get the 'direction' players and entities are facing
 - getPlayerId(playerName) - get the entity of a player by name
 - pollChatPosts() - get events back for posts to the chat

Note - extra features are NOT guaranteed to be maintained in future releases, particularly if updates are made to the original Pi API which replace the functionality

## Config

Modify config.yml:

 - port: 4711 - the default tcp port can be changed in config.yml
 - location: RELATIVE - determine whether locations are RELATIVE to the spawn point (default like pi) or ABSOLUTE

## Libraries

To use the extra features an modded version of the java and python libraries that were originally supplied by Mojang with the Pi is required, [github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice/tree/master/src/main/resources/mcpi](https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice/tree/master/src/main/resources/mcpi).

You only need the modded libraries to use the extra features, the original libraries supplied with Minecraft Pi edition still work, you just wont be able to use the extra features

## Build

To build RaspberryJuice, [download and install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html), clone the repository, run `mvn package':

```
git clone https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice
cd RaspberryJuice
mvn package
```
